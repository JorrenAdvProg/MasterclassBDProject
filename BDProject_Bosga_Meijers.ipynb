The entire dataset currently consists of 29 years of GSS data. It is the only full-probability, personal-interview survey designed to monitor changes in both social characteristics and attitudes currently being conducted in the United States. Because it has been conducted for so many years, with many questions remaining the same, it is a very useful dataset to investigate trends with. \n",

Initially we worked in Spyder as we could collaborate using Github, but there we had to load the data everytime we ran the full program, which took a lot of time. We made a separate data loading program before we realized that Jupyter works with blocks. Luckily we could incorporate some of our previous code, and we now work on this notebook through Github, although the updated file has to be uploaded to the server each time. "
